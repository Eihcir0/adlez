Techonologies:

- The game will be written in Javascript using Canvas and HTML5
- While the game will be simple, it will be structured in a way that it can be greatly improved.  For example, Monsters and Heros will both be classes inherited from a Moveable class.


Timeline: 

- Sep 10-12 - Phase 0 - Research sprite animation techniques and JS game making through tutorials and online research.
- Sep 13 - Phase 1 - Create Immovable class, Hero class, and Monster class.  By end of phase have Hero and monsters moving on board.
- Sep 14 - Phase 2 - Implement attack, experience, leveling, and gold.
- Sep 15 - Phase 3 - Implement bonus features.
- Sep 16 - Phase 4 - Game welcome screen, game over screen and polsh
- Sep 17 - Submit final game.
